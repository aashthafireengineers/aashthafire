            <h1>Fire Risk Assessment (FRA)</h1>
            <p><strong>A Fire Risk Assessment (FRA)</strong> is a professional systematized examination of
                premises, undertaken in order to analyze the hazards and risks, which has the
                potential to cause a fire and lead to harm to those in or around the premises.
                <br><br>The meaning of the terms <strong>“Hazard” and “Risk”</strong> are not the same in relation to
                fire.
                Hazard is defined as something that has the potential to cause harm or loss,
                whereas Risk is defined as the likelihood of that harm or loss, occurring in
                defined circumstances, along with its consequences.
