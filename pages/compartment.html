            <div class="compart-info">
                <p>Compartmentation is a fundamental element of passive fire protection. It refers to the isolation of
                    the parts of a building in order to prevent the spread of fire and smoke to or from another fire
                    compartment. In other words, constructing the parts of the premise with fire resistant materials in
                    order to confine any fire into a smaller area, is called compartmentation.</p>

                <h2>Fire-resistant Barriers</h2>
                <p><strong>Wall Construction</strong></p>
                <p>Fire-resistant barriers such as concrete, plasterboard, and fire-resistant glass are used to create a
                    division between areas, preventing fire from spreading across floors or between rooms.</p>
                <p><strong>Floor and Ceiling Barriers</strong></p>
                <p>Fire-resistant barriers are applied to floors and ceilings to contain fires vertically, particularly
                    in
                    multi-storey buildings, ensuring fires stay confined to one level.</p>
                <p><strong>Fire Resistance Ratings</strong></p>
                <p>These barriers are rated for their ability to withstand fire (e.g., FR30, FR60, FR90, FR120). Higher
                    ratings provide greater protection, with more fire resistance time.</p>
                <p><strong>Compartment Sizes</strong></p>
                <p>The barriers divide a building into fire compartments based on its use, which limits the spread of
                    fire
                    and smoke and helps in fire containment.</p>
                <p><strong>Integration with Other Systems</strong></p>
                <p>Fire-resistant barriers must be designed to complement other fire safety systems, like fire doors and
                    fire stopping, to create an effective passive fire protection system.</p>
                <p><strong>Building Codes Compliance</strong></p>
                <p>Fire-resistant barriers must meet local fire safety regulations and building codes to ensure the
                    structure provides adequate protection.</p>

                <h2>FIRE DOOR SURVEYS</h2>
                <p><strong>Fire-resistant doors are typically used to partition the areas within a building, such as
                        between
                        rooms and corridors or between stairways and halls.</strong></p><br>
                <p>For providing adequate protection through fire doors, the following needs to be implemented:
                </p>
                <ul class="fire-door-points">
                    <li>Fire doors should remain closed</li>
                    <li>It should have fire resistant ratings, like FR30, FR60</li>
                    <li>It should have intumescent strips and smoke seals to resist the passage of fire and smoke</li>
                    <li>The glazing in the door should be fire rated</li>
                    <li>It should have 3 hinges</li>
                    <li>It should be fitted with self-closing device</li>
                    <li>The door should always open in the direction of travel and should also open to 90 degrees</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="fire-stopping-step">
                    <h3>Sealing Gaps and Voids</h3>
                    <p>Fire stopping involves sealing gaps or openings around pipes, cables, ducts, and other
                        penetrations to
                        prevent the spread of fire and smoke through these spaces.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fire-stopping-step">
                    <h3>Materials Used</h3>
                    <p>Intumescent sealants, fire-resistant foams, mineral wool, and fire-resistant boards are commonly
                        used for
                        fire stopping. These materials expand when exposed to heat, filling gaps and blocking fire and
                        smoke
                        from spreading.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fire-stopping-step">
                    <h3>Through-Penetration Protection</h3>
                    <p>Fire stopping ensures that penetrations like pipes or cables passing through fire-resistant
                        barriers do
                        not compromise the fire-resistance integrity of the walls, floors, or ceilings.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fire-stopping-step">
                    <h3>Ductwork and Ventilation Systems</h3>
                    <p>Fire stopping is especially important in sealing ventilation ducts and service shafts. Fire
                        dampers and
                        intumescent coatings are used to prevent the spread of fire and smoke through these systems.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fire-stopping-step">
                    <h3>Building Service Areas</h3>
                    <p>Key areas like electrical, plumbing, or mechanical services require fire stopping to prevent
                        compromising
                        the fire barriers around these penetrations.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fire-stopping-step">
                    <h3>Regular Inspections and Maintenance</h3>
                    <p>Fire stopping must be regularly inspected and maintained to ensure it remains intact, as seals
                        can
                        degrade over time, weakening the fire protection.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fire-stopping-step">
                    <h3>Code Compliance</h3>
                    <p>Fire stopping materials and techniques must comply with building codes and fire safety
                        regulations to
                        ensure their effectiveness and meet safety standards.

            <div class="fire-compart-steps">

                <div class="fire-compart">
                    <h3>Compliance with Building Codes</h3>
                    <p>National and international building codes, including NFPA (National Fire Protection Association)
                        and NBC
                        (National Building Code), recognize fire compartmentation as a core element of fire safety
                        design. It is
                        a mandatory feature to ensure that buildings meet safety standards and regulations.</p>

                <div class="fire-compart">
                    <h3>Fire Control and Risk Mitigation</h3>
                    <p>Properly implemented compartmentation plays a critical role in controlling fire spread. It
                        significantly
                        reduces the potential loss of life and property damage by confining fire and smoke to a limited
                        area,
                        buying valuable time for evacuation and firefighting efforts.</p>

                <div class="fire-compart">
                    <h3>Fire Risk Assessments</h3>
                    <p>Compartmentation is a key component in fire risk assessments, which evaluate the effectiveness of
                        a
                        buildingâ€™s fire safety measures. Ensuring that compartmentation meets the required standards is
                        essential for maintaining the safety of both the occupants and the structure.</p>
