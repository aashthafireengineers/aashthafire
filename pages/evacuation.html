                <h3>In the event of a fire, it's crucial to have a pre-arranged evacuation plan, in order to ensure a
                    reasonable safety of human beings.
                </h3>
                <p>Evacuation strategies act as a decisive factor in ensuring prompt and safe evacuation of the
                    occupants. It also helps to deal with human behavioural aspects efficiently in the event of a fire
                    and ensure
                    optimum safety.

                    <h3>STAGED EVACUATION</h3>
                    <p>The staged evacuation basically involves immediate evacuation of everyone on the premises to the
                        assembly point, as soon as the fire alarm sounds. For this type of evacuation, the design of the
                        building must cater with the means of escape, even if one exit route is compromised. In
                        addition,
                        the width of the staircases should be sufficient to keep the flow of the occupants, from any
                        floor,
                        down the stairs to the exit and the passage should be free from any restrictions.

                <div class="phased-evac">
                    <h3>PHASED EVACUATION</h3>
                    <p>The phased evacuation basically involves evacuation of different areas of the premises in a
                        controlled sequence of phases, evacuating those who are at greater risk first, remaining
                        occupants
                        being alerted but should stay in the building unless the fire develops and spreads.
                        <br><strong>In order to achieve phased evacuation, the following needs to be
                            implemented:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul class="phased-evac-list">
                        <li>Every floor must act as a compartment</li>
                        <li>The lobbies approaching the means of escape must have fire protection</li>
                        <li>Automatic fire detection and alarm system needs to be installed in all floors</li>
                        <li>Public addressing systems are recommended</li>
                        <li>Comprehensive staff training is inevitable</li>
