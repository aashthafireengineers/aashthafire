                <p>System integration comprises the core engineering part of our services. It basically integrates the
                    different fire safety technologies into one all-inclusive automated fire safety system, enhancing
                    the overall safety of the occupants and assets for our clients.</p>
                <p>It includes planning, drawing, designing, supplying, installing, commissioning, testing and
                    maintaining fire prevention, fire detection and fire protection systems in your premises.</p>

                    <div class="intri-type">
                        <h3>Fire Detection and Alarm System (FDAS)</h3>
                        <p>This system is designed to detect a fire and raise the alarm effectively. It includes
                            detectors- smoke/ heat/ multi criteria, alarm panels, manual call points (MCP).</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="intri-type">
                        <h3>Fire Suppression System</h3>
                        <p>This system is designed to extinguish a fire or control its spread. It includes water based
                            suppression (sprinkler system), gas-based suppression (carbon dioxide, FM200) like CO2
                            flooding system and wet chemical based suppression (solution of potassium salts).</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="intri-type">
                        <h3>Smoke Control System</h3>
                        <p>This system is designed to control the spread of poisonous smoke, generated in case of a
                            fire, being fatal for human inhalation. It can be done by either pressurising particular
                            areas, like staircase, lift shaft or lobby, to stop smoke infiltration, or by venting it to
                            the exterior. Fire doors with proper ratings play a crucial role in preventing the spread of
                            heat and smoke, thus increasing the time for safe evacuation.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="intri-type">
                        <h3>Emergency Lighting and Exit Signage</h3>
                        <p>This system is designed to illuminate exit signs and turn on emergency lighting as soon as
                            the primary power supply goes off in the event of a fire.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="intri-type">
                        <h3>Public Address and Voice Alarm (PAVA) System</h3>
                        <p>This system is designed to convey critical information to all occupants by delivering
                            pre-recorded messages or live announcements, according to the need of the emergency.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="intri-type">
                        <h3>Building Management System (BMS)</h3>
                        <p>This is designed to control all the systems installed in the building or premise, through one
                            computer-based platform. It includes the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
                            system, Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) surveillance system, Lighting systems, Fire safety
                            systems, and other Security systems.</p>

        <div class="intri-process">
            <h2>How does the integration work?</h2>
            <span><p>System Integration basically provides a fully automatic system that operates without any human
                intervention, in case of an emergency, enhancing efficiency of managing the situation. Basically as soon
                as the fire is detected, all the installed systems get activated automatically at the same time.</p></span>
            <div class="intri-process-steps">
                <p>At first, the fire gets detected by the different types of detectors installed and the alarm is
                    raised automatically.</p>
                <p>The fire suppression systems get automatically activated and release water, gas, or wet chemicals.
                </p>
                <p>Integration with the HVAC systems facilitates shutting the dampers, thus containing the smoke in the
                    ventilation system.</p>
                <p>The smoke control system gets activated and confines the smoke in designated regions, as all the
                    systems are linked together.</p>
                <p>Emergency lighting and PAVA systems are triggered simultaneously, facilitating efficient evacuation.
                </p>

        <div class="intri-importance">
            <h2>Why is system integration important?</h2>
            <div class="intri-reasons">
                <ul>
                    <li>Enhances overall safety of people and property, ensuring that there is no lag between detection,
                        suppression, and evacuation.</li>
                    <li>Improves the response time as multiple safety measures get triggered at the same time.</li>
                    <li>It is cost effective as it helps in protecting the expensive systems from fire damage and also
                        leads to energy efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Centralized safety control panel helps in monitoring and maintaining all the installed systems
                        together from one central location.</li>
                    <li>Minimizes chances of human error as all the systems are fully automatic.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="maintenance">
            <h2>Maintenance</h2>
            <p>In order to minimise fire mishaps, safeguard individuals and assets of our clients, we provide annual
                maintenance programmes to ensure that all fire safety systems are operating at their optimum
                effectiveness and are compliant to the current regulations.</p>
