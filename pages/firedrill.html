            <ul>
                <li>Compliance with the requirements of the current legislation. According to the National Building Code
                    (NBC), fire drills should be conducted periodically, in accordance with the Fire Safety Plan of the
                    premises.</li>
                <li>Ensure all occupants are aware of the necessary actions to be taken in the event of a fire</li>
                <li>Enable calm and efficient evacuation of all occupants</li>
                <li>All installed systems are fully functional at all points</li>
                <li>Foster serious consideration of fire alarms</li>
                <li>Assist participants in keeping their calm and adhering to a pre-decided systematic evacuation plan
                    because panic can play a significant role in mishaps during a genuine fire event.</li>
            </ul>
